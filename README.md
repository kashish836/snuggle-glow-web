  "Create a cute, heartwarming, and modern website for new mothers of newborn babies. The website should have soft pastel colors like baby pink, baby blue, mint, and lavender. The tone should feel warm, supportive, and calming. Include:

A homepage with a welcoming message and featured baby tips.

A blog section for newborn care, sleep tips, and emotional support for mothers.

A resource center with downloadable checklists, feeding schedules, and milestone trackers.

A community section or forum where moms can connect.

Testimonials from other moms for emotional reassurance.

Easy navigation, soft rounded fonts, cute icons (baby bottles, rattles, hearts, stars), and gentle animations.

A contact form and newsletter sign-up for baby care updates.

The overall aesthetic should feel like a blend of Pinterest and a baby journal – clean, soothing, and full of love."
